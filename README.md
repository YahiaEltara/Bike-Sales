# Bike-Sales
As a Excel Project, it is a little dataset with a around 8-10 columns about bike buyers, how its martial status is, their age, income and its gender & how much they buy and the quantity. so i decided to analyse it with a prespective that "How do the sales look like if the gender is Male or Female" or about what is the relation between the income and the total sales & if there is a relation between the miles they walk and the purchased status and so on.
